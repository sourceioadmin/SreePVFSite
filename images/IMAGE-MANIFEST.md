# Image manifest — homepage (`index.html`)

> This file also covers the About/Founders/Media/Contact pages — see the
> [second table](#image-manifest--about--founders--media--contact-us-pages) below.

No WordPress backup or manual image export has been supplied yet, so every image/background slot on
the homepage currently renders `images/placeholder.svg` (content images) or the `.bg-placeholder` CSS
pattern (background-image slots), tagged with a `data-image-slot` key. This table maps each key back to
its best-identified original asset on **https://sreepvf.org/**, so real files can be dropped in later
without re-auditing the page.

**Confidence key:** ✅ confirmed via direct DOM inspection · ⚠️ best-effort match, verify before use.

Same placeholder scheme as above (`images/placeholder.svg` + `data-image-slot`), for
`about-us.html`, `founders.html`, `videos.html`, `picture-gallery.html`, and `contact-us.html`.

Seethadevi Foundation awardees 1989–2013+) | Each slide has its own source image on the live nivo-slider widget (`Image2023...` filenames); not individually captured — 28 distinct portraits | `honoree-01-photo.jpg` … `honoree-28-photo.jpg` | ⚠️ verify each against the live slideshow before use |

**Videos page note:** `videos.html` embeds the live site's real YouTube videos directly (published
third-party content, not a missing media asset — see WEBSITE-STANDARDS.md placeholder policy scope).
IDs used: `LXOGvRZtKWM` (Sree Padmavathi Venkateswara Foundation), `ONrb17fjAEQ` (Sree Ramakrishna
Translational Research Grant), `Tlxr5GTE4m0` (AI pest modeling), `n85yEGvbfAc` (post-harvest tech),
`iDOvJJPBKO8` (edible coating tech). No manifest entries needed for these.

**Picture Gallery — individual photo rows:**

The live gallery renders these 95 photos (a WordPress infinite-loop slider clones a few items at
the wrap boundary; duplicates have been removed here — verify actual gallery photo count/order
against the live page before dropping in real files, since re-ordering may have occurred since this
was captured).

**Essay Contests PDF files** (not images — the 4 thumbnails above each link to one of these; hrefs
are `#` in `sreepvf-essay-contests.html` until the real files are downloaded and dropped into the
project, e.g. under a new `files/` folder, then wired to the matching `data-pdf-slot`):

**Note on awardee names:** every awardee name on the live Biomedical/Agricultural Awards pages
links to a per-year detail page (e.g. `/biomedical-research-grant-awardee-2019`). Those detail
pages are out of scope for this pass — names are rendered as plain (non-link) text in
`biomedical-awards.html`/`agricultural-awards.html` rather than pointing at pages that don't exist
yet. Revisit if/when those detail pages get built.

## Image manifest — Research Grants / Biomedical Science / Agricultural Science pages

Same placeholder scheme as above, for `research-grants.html`, `biomedical-science.html`, and
`agricultural-science.html`. All three also use the shared `subpage-hero-bg` slot. A live-site
investigation reached the limits of what it could individually confirm for several committee-member
photos (marked ⚠️ below) — worth a follow-up pass against the live pages before dropping in real

**Note on "Previous Awardees"/"Awardees" years:** same as the Biomedical/Agricultural Awards pages
— each year links to a per-year detail page on the live site that's out of scope for this
migration pass, so years render as plain bold text here rather than dead links.

**Note on dead/hidden content:** the live `research-grants.html` page contains a large block of
"Biomedical Sciences"/"Agricultural Sciences" write-up content (intro text, evaluation process,
full committee rosters) that carries `elementor-hidden-desktop/tablet/mobile` on every wrapper —
i.e. it's permanently hidden at every breakpoint and never rendered for real visitors. This was
deliberately **not** reproduced, per WEBSITE-STANDARDS.md's warning against replicating dead
leftover markup.

## How to replace a placeholder

1. Save the real file into `images/` using the recommended filename above (or your own — just keep it
   kebab-case and descriptive, per WEBSITE-STANDARDS.md §4).
2. Find the element by its `data-image-slot` value in the relevant page (`index.html`,
   `about-us.html`, `founders.html`, `videos.html`, `picture-gallery.html`, or `contact-us.html` —
   `subpage-hero-bg` appears in all five of the latter).
3. For a content `<img>`: change `src="images/placeholder.svg"` to the new path and remove the
   `img-placeholder` class.
4. For a background slot (`.bg-placeholder`, e.g. the two hero slides and the video frame): remove the
   `bg-placeholder` class and `data-placeholder-label` attribute, and add an inline
   `style="background-image:url('images/your-file.jpg'); background-size:cover; background-position:center;"`
   (or move the rule into `css/pages/index.css`).
5. Delete that row from this manifest once it's done, so the file always reflects what's still
   outstanding.
